## App Review Notes
This app is for walk/hike organizers to share their live location with event participants. Participants view the organizer's location through a web browser - they don't need to install this app.

The app requires location permissions to:
1. Center the map on the user's current position when creating routes
2. Broadcast the organizer's location during walking events

Location is only accessed when the user explicitly initiates these actions.

Test credentials: Not required (no login needed)
