## App Review Notes
This app is for walk/hike organizers to share their live location with event participants. Participants view the organizer's location through a web browser - they don't need to install this app.

The app requires location permissions to:
1. Center the map on the user's current position when creating routes
2. Broadcast the organizer's location during walking events

Location is only accessed when the user explicitly initiates these actions.
