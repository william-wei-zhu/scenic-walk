Never lose your walking group again!

Scenic Walk makes it easy to organize group walks, guided tours, hikes, and outdoor activities with real-time GPS location sharing. Whether you're leading a nature walk, a city tour, or a community hike, participants can always see where you are on the map.

FEATURES FOR ORGANIZERS:

• Create Events - Draw your walking route on an interactive map with tap-to-add points. Set a name and secure PIN for your event.

• Live GPS Broadcasting - Share your real-time location with all participants. Broadcasting continues even when your phone is locked or the app is in the background.

• Easy Sharing - Share your event with a simple link. Participants can follow along on any device with a web browser - no app download required for them!

• Privacy Protection - Your location is only shared while you're actively broadcasting. Stop anytime and your location is immediately removed.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Create an event and draw your planned route
2. Share the event link with your group
3. Start broadcasting when you begin walking
4. Participants see your live location on the map
5. Stop broadcasting when you're done

PERFECT FOR:

• Community walking groups
• Guided city tours
• Nature hikes and trail walks
• School or organization outings
• Bird watching groups
• Photography walks
• Dog walking meetups
• Running clubs

PRIVACY & BATTERY:

• Location is only shared when you choose to broadcast
• Efficient background service minimizes battery usage
• No account required - events are stored locally on your device
• Open source (AGPL-3.0) - verify the code yourself at github.com/william-wei-zhu/scenic-walk
