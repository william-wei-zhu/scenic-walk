# Privacy Policy for Scenic Walk

**Last updated: January 25, 2025**

## Overview

Scenic Walk ("we", "our", or "the app") is an open-source application for organizing walking events with live GPS location sharing. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
- **GPS coordinates**: When you actively broadcast your location as an event organizer, your device's GPS coordinates are collected and shared with event participants.
- **Location accuracy**: We also collect location accuracy data to help participants understand the precision of your location.

### Event Data
- **Event information**: Event name, route waypoints, creation timestamp, and organizer PIN.
- **Event ID**: A unique identifier for each event.

### Local Storage
- **Saved events**: Events you create or join are stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Location sharing**: Your GPS location is shared with participants viewing your event, only while you are actively broadcasting.
- **Event management**: Event data is stored to allow you to manage and share your walking events.

## Data Sharing

- **Event participants**: Your live location is visible to anyone with your event link while you are broadcasting.
- **Firebase**: Event and location data is stored in Google Firebase Realtime Database to enable real-time synchronization.
- **No third-party advertising**: We do not share your data with advertisers or data brokers.

## Data Retention

- **Location data**: Your location is removed from our servers immediately when you stop broadcasting.
- **Event data**: Event information remains stored until the event is deleted.
- **Local data**: Events saved on your device remain until you remove them from the app.

## Your Rights and Controls

- **Start/Stop broadcasting**: You control when your location is shared by starting or stopping the broadcast.
- **Privacy protection**: When you stop broadcasting, your location is immediately cleared from our servers.
- **Delete events**: You can remove events from your device at any time.
- **No account required**: The app does not require you to create an account.

## Data Security
