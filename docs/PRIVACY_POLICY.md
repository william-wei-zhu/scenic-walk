# Privacy Policy for Scenic Walk

**Last Updated:** [INSERT DATE]

## Introduction

Scenic Walk ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Scenic Walk mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data

- **Foreground Location:** When you actively use the App to broadcast your location, we collect your precise GPS coordinates.
- **Background Location:** With your explicit permission, we collect your location even when the App is not in the foreground. This is used to continuously broadcast your location to event participants.

### Event Data

- **Event Information:** Event names, routes, and organizer PINs that you create.
- **Device Storage:** Events you create or join are stored locally on your device.

### Automatically Collected Data

- **Crash Reports:** If the App crashes, we collect anonymous crash data to help improve the App (via Firebase Crashlytics).
- **Usage Analytics:** Anonymous usage patterns to improve App functionality (via Firebase Analytics).

## How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:

1. **Enable Core Functionality:** Share your real-time location with event participants.
2. **Improve the App:** Analyze crash reports and usage patterns to fix bugs and add features.
3. **Provide Event Features:** Store and display event information, routes, and organizer locations.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell your personal information. Your data may be shared in the following limited circumstances:

- **Event Participants:** Your location is shared with anyone who has access to your event link while you are actively broadcasting.
- **Service Providers:** We use Firebase (Google) for database, analytics, and crash reporting services. See [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Retention

- **Location Data:** Real-time location data is stored only while actively broadcasting and is cleared when broadcasting stops or the event ends.
- **Event Data:** Events remain in the database until deleted. Local device storage persists until you remove the event or uninstall the App.
- **Analytics Data:** Anonymous usage data is retained according to Firebase's retention policies.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Location Permissions

You can control location permissions through your device settings:
- **Android:** Settings > Apps > Scenic Walk > Permissions > Location

### Data Deletion

To delete your data:
1. Stop broadcasting and remove events from your device
2. Contact us at [INSERT EMAIL] to request deletion of any server-side data

### Opt-Out

- You can stop location sharing at any time by tapping "Stop Broadcasting"
- Uninstall the App to stop all data collection

## Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures including:
- HTTPS encryption for all data transmission
- Firebase security rules to protect database access
- No storage of sensitive data like passwords (only hashed PINs for events)

## Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy
